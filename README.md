Sales Insights – Brick & Mortar Business [Power BI | SQL]


## Project Overview

The Sales Insights dashboard was designed for AtliQ Hardware, a brick-and-mortar business, to provide actionable insights into their sales performance. This Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive view of key sales metrics, helping the business identify trends, track top-performing products, analyze regional sales performance, and understand customer demographics.

By visualizing these insights, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to optimize strategies and potentially increase revenue by at least 7% in the upcoming quarter.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to create an interactive Power BI dashboard to help AtliQ Hardware better understand the sales trends for their products. The dashboard allows users to track sales performance over time, identify top-performing products, regions, and customer demographics, and make data-driven decisions to optimize sales strategies.

The insights derived from this dashboard will provide the business with actionable recommendations that can potentially increase revenue by at least 7% in the next quarter. This tool is crucial for understanding which products and regions have higher sales performance and which areas need improvement.

## Key Insights:
1. Sales Trend: The dashboard highlights overall sales performance, including monthly, quarterly, and yearly trends. This gives insight into peak sales periods, helping the business focus on strategies for slow months.

2. Top Products: The dashboard visualizes which hardware products are best-sellers and which ones are lagging. By understanding these patterns, AtliQ can focus marketing efforts on high-performing products and improve the promotion of lower-performing ones.

3. Regional Sales: Users can filter the dashboard to view sales data by region. This allows AtliQ to identify geographical areas with strong sales and areas that require further attention.

4. Customer Demographics: The dashboard tracks customer demographics such as age, gender, and buying behaviour, which helps AtliQ tailor marketing campaigns more effectively.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Gathered sales data from AtliQ’s SQL database.
- Step 2: Used SQL queries to clean and transform the data, ensuring only relevant sales records were pulled.
- Step 3: Loaded the cleaned dataset into Power BI Desktop for analysis and visualization.
- Step 4: Analyzed sales data for patterns such as product popularity, seasonal sales fluctuations, and regional performance.
- Step 5: Created measures and calculated columns to represent key sales metrics like Total Sales, Sales Growth, Average Order Value, etc.
- Step 6: Designed interactive visuals such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to display sales trends, top products, and regional comparisons.
- Step 7: Added slicers for filtering by time period, product category, and region to make the dashboard more interactive.
- Step 8: Used DAX functions to create dynamic measures for sales growth, top-performing products, and customer segments.
- Step 9: Published the dashboard to Power BI Service and set up a scheduled refresh for real-time updates.

## Insights & Impact
1. Sales Performance
- Total Sales Growth: The dashboard reveals a 5% increase in sales during Q3, with a significant uptick in sales from the product category. This insight indicates an opportunity to further capitalize on this trend in Q4.
- Seasonal Trends: Sales spike during the holiday season, suggesting the need for more targeted promotions and campaigns to maximize revenue during peak periods.
2. Product Insights
- Best-Selling Products: Product A accounts for 25% of the total sales, marking it as a key revenue driver. This data can guide future stock allocation and promotional efforts.
- Underperforming Products: Product C has seen a 10% decrease in sales compared to the previous quarter. This indicates a potential need for marketing revamps or discounting strategies.
3. Regional Insights
- Top Performing Regions: Region 1 leads in overall sales, followed by Region 2.
- Sales Decline in Region 3: Sales performance in Region 3 has been sluggish. Further investigation into regional challenges—such as market competition or local promotions—will be needed to address this gap.
4. Customer Demographics
- Age Groups: The largest customer segment is aged 25-45, representing 60% of total sales. This demographic insight is valuable for creating targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with the primary audience.
- Gender Distribution: Sales are predominantly male (60%), with females representing 40% of total sales. Understanding gender preferences helps in designing personalized campaigns.
5. Revenue Opportunities
- Targeted Marketing: By leveraging the insights on product performance, regions, and customer demographics, AtliQ can implement more effective marketing strategies, leading to a projected 7% increase in sales next quarter.
- Product Strategy: Promoting underperforming products or introducing new versions based on customer feedback can improve overall sales.
## Conclusion
The Sales Insights dashboard provides AtliQ Hardware with the data-driven insights needed to make informed decisions about product offerings, marketing strategies, and regional focus. The actionable insights derived from this dashboard are critical for optimizing sales performance and ensuring that the business is well-positioned for growth in the upcoming quarters.
